# This file has a sample configuration for a very quick training of tictactoe players with sockets.
# The goal is just to see if everything is working, to train actual good players
# check the other configuration files.

# Sample result:
#   ### Summary Per Run
#   
#   Global Mean Fitness Score per Training per Run:
#   [0.335]
#   mean: 0.335
#   
#   Global Max. Fitness Score per Training per Run:
#   [0.375]
#   mean: 0.375
#   
#   Global Mean Validation Score per Validation per Run:
#   [0.3575]
#   mean: 0.3575
#   
#   Global Max. Validation Score per Validation per Run:
#   [0.375]
#   mean: 0.375
#   
#   Champion Score per Validation per Run:
#   [0.3625]
#   mean: 0.3625
#   
#   Finished execution, total elapsed time: 0.08153 mins (mean: 0.08153, std: 0.0)
